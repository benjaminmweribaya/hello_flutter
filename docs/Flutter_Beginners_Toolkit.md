## 5. Minimal Working Example

We‚Äôll build a Flutter ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù app.

### Step 1: Create a Project

```powershell
flutter create hello_flutter
cd hello_flutter
```

### Step 2: Replace `lib/main.dart` with:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Hello World',
      theme: ThemeData(useMaterial3: true),
      home: const HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeScreen({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Flutter Hello World')),
      body: const Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello, World! üëã',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 28, fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Run on device

```powershell
flutter run
```

**Expected Output:**

* App bar with title: *Flutter Hello World*
* Centered text: *Hello, World! üëã*
